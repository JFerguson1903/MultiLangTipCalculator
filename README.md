## Description

As a first project outside of my Bootcamp experience, I wanted to create a Tip Calculator that you would be able to use in multiple languages and also using a database. 

As a customer, I want to calculate tips so I can save time while paying.


Additional usage:

- There is to be a sliding bar to select a different or more specific percentage.
- Provide quick select buttons for faster more used percentage calculations.
- Have an option to be able to change the language on the tip calculator for wider audience of use.
