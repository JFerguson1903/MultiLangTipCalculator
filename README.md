## Description

Movies have always been a large part of my life.  Getting to go to the theatre was something special and to be remembered. Over time it has become harder to hold onto the memories via the  ticket stubs. 

As a movie theatre-goer, I want to be able to archive my experiences so I can reflect and share my history going to the cinemas.



Additional usage:

- Movie Posters load to help identify the movie that was seen.
- Notes section for items like event details, date, who you saw it with, thoughts about the movie.
- Additional entry box to document if you saw the movie in theatres more than once.
